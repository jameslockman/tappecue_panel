# tappecue_panel
A panel for Adobe applications that shows Tappecue data. Never be away from your BBQ again.

This project is a CEP Panel for Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It provides access to your smoke session through the Tappecue API, generously offered by Frank Dice. https://frankdice.github.io/tappecue-api/ Once you log in to Tappecue, you will see four temperatures displayed in the panel. The panel updates every 30 seconds.

Once logged in, you can open the panel in other CC apps and they will also log in. When you log out, those other panels will also log out, but it may take up to a minute for that to happen autpomatically.

Over time, we might make it more full-featured, but for now, it's there to help you focus on what's important while you work: your BBQ!
