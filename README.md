# tappecue_panel
A panel for Adobe applications that shows Tappecue data. Never be away from your BBQ again.

This project is a CEP Panel for Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It provides access to your smoke session through the Tappecue API. https://frankdice.github.io/tappecue-api/ Once you log in to Tappecue, you will see four temperatures displayed in the panel. The panel updates every 30 seconds.

Over time, we might make it more full-featured, but for now, it's there to help you focus on what's important while you work: your BBQ!
